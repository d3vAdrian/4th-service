2. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Flask server using `python3 main.py`.

### Usage

#### Fetching Streaming URLs for Movies

To fetch streaming URLs for a movie, make a GET request to the `/api/sources/<tmdb_id>` endpoint, where `<tmdb_id>` is the TMDB ID of the movie.

Example:

```http
GET /api/sources/12345
```

#### Fetching Streaming URLs for TV Shows

To fetch streaming URLs for a TV show episode, make a GET request to the `/api/sources/<tmdb_id>/<season>/<episode>` endpoint, where `<tmdb_id>` is the TMDB ID of the TV show, `<season>` is the season number, and `<episode>` is the episode number.

Example:

```http
GET /api/sources/67890/1/1
```

### API Responses

The API will respond with a JSON object containing the streaming URLs, subtitles (if available), and download options (if configured).

Example Response:

```json
{
  "sources": [
    {
      "server": 1,
      "url": "https://example.com/stream1"
    },
    {
      "server": 2,
      "url": "https://example.com/stream2"
    }
  ],
